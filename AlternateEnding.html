    <h2>Sleeves</h2>
    <p>
    The Beatles were a favourite band of both my parents.  As I child I enjoyed ‘Magical Mystery Tour’ for the songs and the book that goes with it.  The album is in good condition but the sleeve is a bit worn.  The Beatles had some great album artwork.  The Sgt. Pepper album with all the famous people on it, the minimalist white sleeve of the eponymous album and the interwoven drawing on the cover of Revolver are some of my favourites, and who hasn't tried to copy the Abbey Road cover?  The album ‘Animals’ by Pink Floyd was one that my dad owned.  I love the cover image of the inflatable pig floating over Battersea Power Station.

    <h2>Shoe Box</h2>
    <p>
    I have an old shoe box to hold the seven inches in, as it is exactly the right size to hold them.  They are a bit squished in at the moment, I think I need another one.  I have a flight case for twelve inches, not that I have ever taken them anywhere, I just liked the look of it.  It matches the one I have for CDs.  Next on my list of purchases is a new turntable, although I have one that still works, so I really don't need it.
