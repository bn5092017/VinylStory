  <h1>Vinyl Junkie</h1>
    <h2>Singles</h2>
    <p>
    I have a collection of 7 inch singles, some purchased because I loved the song, others because of the novelty value.
    One of my favourites is Cornershop’s ‘Brimful of Asha’.  This achieved more success with the b-side remix
    by Norman Cook than the original version.  It was my introduction to this band and I bought the album
    ‘When I was born for the 7th time’ because I enjoyed it so much. Two of my Teenage Fanclub singles are ‘What you
    do to me’ and ‘Radio’.  I love the sleeves on these singles. Talking Heads ‘And she was’ I bought for the bargain
    price of 50p.

    <h2>Unusual items</h2>
    <p>
    I am a sucker for limited editions, particularly coloured vinyl singles.  Many of those I have only listened to once,
    if even once. For example, the lemon single ‘Squashy Lemon Squeezy’ by Pocket Size was bought because of the lemon
    yellow vinyl.  I had to check which was the band and which was the song on the back of the sleeve and I have
    no idea how it goes.  I bought this set of singles by the Beatles in coloured vinyl in the Virgin Megastore on
    Aston Quay.  They are quite expensive imports at £3.49 each.  I bought Fountains of Wayne ‘I want an alien for
    Christmas’ because I love Christmas songs, so I do know how this one goes.  ‘Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)’
    by Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel is a 7 inch meant for a jukebox I think.  It has no label, the information
    is etched into the vinyl.  Primal Scream’s ‘Echo Dek’ is an album on five 7 inches.  I bought this because I like
    the band, but mainly for the novelty value.
