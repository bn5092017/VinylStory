<h1>Vinyl Junkie</h1>
<h2>Acquisitions</h2>
<p>
    There is nothing quite so satisfying as coming home with a new record.  Vinyl versions of albums can be expensive
    these days and it is easier to download anything I want to listen to regularly, but I still love owning a real album.
    My collection includes records I bought and items previously owned by members of my family.  I rescued everything
    they no longer wanted when they decided to leave vinyl behind.  There are some items in my collection I would
    be embarrassed to let others see, but I still keep them even though I have never listened to them.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
    Hits 5 is the first album I owned.  My parents bought it for me for Christmas one year.  It includes gems like
    Paul Simon’s ‘You can call me Al’ and Julian Cope’s ‘World shut your mouth’.   The first single I bought was either
    Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers’ ‘Swing the mood’ or Robert Palmer and UB40’s ‘I’ll be your baby tonight’, I can’t
    remember which one I bought first.  The album ‘Animals’ by Pink Floyd was one that my dad owned.  I love the cover
    image of the inflatable pig floating over Battersea Power Station.   The Beatles were a favourite band of both my
    parents.  As I child I enjoyed ‘Magical Mystery Tour’ for the songs and the book that goes with it.
